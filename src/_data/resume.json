        "When I discovered coding (while enjoying the 'extraordinary discovery' - those two seconds of dopamine induced movement, thought and sensation throughout) my mouth wispered 'I want more!' in that very familiar Mortal Kombat 'Fatality voice', just like a zombie, so yeah I was hooked. I mean through the chest like in those horror movies, only the hook is similar to Donnie Darko's 'liquid tunnel of intention' if I may. I'm self motivated and in constant competition with myself. Really. I think everyone should be at least 50% of the time. I have a keen interest in all web development technologies and I can't really not have it this way. I tried but it's the only way I can give birth to my ideas and get rid of them. Otherwise they just pile up like packs of toilet paper that everyone in your usual shared house decided to buy in the same day.",
